**Problem Description**

Given two strings A and B. Find the longest common subsequence ( A sequence which does not need to be contiguous), which
is common in both the strings.

You need to return the length of such longest common subsequence.

**Problem Constraints**

1 <= Length of A, B <= 1005

**Input Format**

First argument is a string A.

Second argument is a string B.

**Output Format**

Return an integer denoting the length of the longest common subsequence.

**Example Input**

**Input 1:**

A = "abbcdgf"

B = "bbadcgf"

**Input 2:**

A = "aaaaaa"

B = "ababab"

**Example Output**

**Output 1:**

5

**Output 2:**

3

**Example Explanation**

**Explanation 1:**

The longest common subsequence is "bbcgf", which has a length of 5.

**Explanation 2:**

The longest common subsequence is "aaa", which has a length of 3.
